#     7. In mathematics, Cnk denotes the number of different ways that k things
#        can be selected from among n different choices. For example, if you are
#        choosing among six desserts and are allowed to take two, the number
#        of different combinations you could choose is eô€€®. Here's one formula to
#        compute this value:
#                               en n! k =
#                                        k! (n- k) !
#         This value also gives rise to an interesting recursion:
#                          ekn -- ekn--11 + ekn -1
#         Write both an iterative and a recursive function to compute combinations
#         and compare the efficiency of your two solutions. Hints: When k = 1,
#         e;: = n and when n < k, e;: = 0.
