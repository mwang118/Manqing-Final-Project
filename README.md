# Manqing-Final-Project
#### This repository features my IS452 final project for term SP2020.

It contains two chapters of my choice for this project which are chapter 8 and 13 from *Python Programming: Introduction to Computer Science* book by John Zelle. Each of them has it own file, in which are 6 programming exercises.

To run py files properly, I suggest installing package inflect upfront in order to run one of the file successfully.
